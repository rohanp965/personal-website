    description:
      'Lead development of machine learning models and data pipelines. Implemented new features, improved performance, and mentored junior developers.',
    achievements: [
      'Increased prescreening efficiency 60% by deploying a classification model which predicts whether a given sentence is relevant or not with business context using BERT, PyTorch, Transformers(Hugging Face), Docker and FastAPI.',
      'Increased prescreening efficiency a further 15% by deploying a text similarity searching model which helps in finding relevant sentences in prescreened texts using Word Embeddings (sentence transformers), Docker and FastAPI.',
      'Deployed an end-to-end pipeline on AWS using S3, Textract, DynamoDB, Lambda Functions and Open Search to parse millions of PDF documents helping in classifying , searching and extracting key information to generate business insights and revenue.',
      'Formulated a POC in collaboration with a new client which included reusing tagging capabilities and resulted in doubling the transactional volume in an existing product and increase in revenue.',
      'Collaborated in the innovation journey for AI/ML in action by deploying enterprise level generic ML/NLP capabilities which enabled reusability of code and a reduced time to market.',
      'Mentored 2 batches of Data Science - Summer Interns by helping create a project roadmap, provide technical and non-technical assistance and oversaw their recruitment and interview process.'
