# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings significant improvements and new features to the React framework. In this post, we'll explore the key features and how to get started with them.

## What's New in Next.js 15

### Server Components
Next.js 15 embraces React Server Components as the default. This means better performance and smaller bundle sizes out of the box.

### Improved App Router
The App Router has been refined with better error handling and enhanced features for nested layouts.

```tsx
// Example of a nested layout
export default function BlogLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="blog-layout">
      <aside>Blog Sidebar</aside>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Enhanced Data Fetching
Server Components make data fetching more intuitive:

```tsx
async function BlogPost() {
  const post = await getPost()
  return <article>{post.content}</article>
}
```

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Next.js project:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-app
   ```

2. Choose the latest features:
   - TypeScript
   - App Router
   - Tailwind CSS
   - ESLint

3. Start developing:
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   npm run dev
   ```

## Best Practices

- Use Server Components by default
- Only use Client Components when needed (interactivity, browser APIs)
- Leverage the new data fetching patterns
- Implement proper error boundaries

Next.js 15 makes building React applications more enjoyable than ever. Happy coding!
